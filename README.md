# FriendFinder
Friend finder is a tool that matches you with your best friend based on a simple ten question survey!

To use friend finder, simply start the survey from the home page, fill our the ten questions, and find your best friend match!

Friend finder uses data from the server as well as match logic from the API Routes to take the user's request and respond with their best match. This app uses node, express, and JSON data as well as HTML, Javascript/JQuery, and some CSS.

Enjoy!
